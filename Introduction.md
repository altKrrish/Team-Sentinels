**Problem Statement Title**
AI/NLP Engine to Detect Serious Injury & Fatality (SIF) Precursors in OIL's Unsafe-Act/Unsafe-Condition and Near-Miss Reports

**Description**	
Background OIL collects large volumes of UA/UC observations, near-miss and incident reports through its HSSE platform but these are triaged manually after certain time intervals such as monthly, quarterly etc.However, Global best practice (DEKRA Martin & Black 2015; EEI SIF Precursor model; VelocityEHS 2024 PSIF classifier) has established that low-severity incidents do not share the same causes as fatalities â€” non-fatal US accidents fell 51% over 15 years while fatalities fell only 25.5%.Leading operators therefore separately flag the ~20â€“25% of reports carrying genuine fatal potential.

Problem Description Build a prototype that ingests OIL's free-text safety reports and automatically 
a) Classifies each as SIF-potential vs non-SIF-potential 
b) Tags it to the relevant IOGP Life-Saving Rule (e.g., Energy Isolation, Hot Work,Confined Space, Line of Fire)
c) Surfaces recurring precursor patterns (activity, location, barrier failure) via a dashboard.

Expected Outcome/Solution A working AI/NLP with an interactive dashboard that ranks sites/activities by SIF-precursor density and auto-maps to Life-Saving Rules, enabling HSE to focus interventions where fatal potential is highest.

Relevant Data Availability (if any)
OIL's UA/UC observations, near-miss and incident reports.
